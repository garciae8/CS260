I don't have much information on the topics within data structures but I looked up on Google and these are the ones I found interesting

1. Trees I think are going to be very interesting because of their hierarchical structure that is linked together
2. Graphs will be interesting because I have a relative interest in using math to create objects and the graphs themselves.
3. I think arrays will be very useful since it seems like they will be used to store a lot of information
4. Similarly Tables are close to arrays but more so for the arrangement and organization of data for complete structures
5. Binary trees sound very interesting with their vertices and having children attached to the nodes 

I think personally me Coding, in general, is a hard topic when it comes to computing 

1. Learning C++ Since the first time I was trying to learn C++ at OSU they expected me to understand it without providing learn materials when I did CS 162 last year in the fall.
2. Probably anything advanced within the data structures assignments that may require algorithms 
3. Machine learning
4. Operating Systems 
5. Anything that requires a lot of trial and error since I have a hard time in general just going through code and finding small mistakes
